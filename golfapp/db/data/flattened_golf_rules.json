This Rule also covers free relief when a players ball is embedded in its own pitch-mark\n            in the general area.\nThese conditions are not treated as part of the challenge of playing the course, and\n                  free relief is generally allowed except in a penalty area. The player normally takes relief by dropping a ball in a relief area based on the\n                  nearest point of complete relief.",

When a ball is\n            lost outside a penalty area or comes to rest out of bounds, the required progression\n            of playing from the teeing area to the hole is broken; the player must resume that\n            progression by playing again from where the previous stroke was made.
